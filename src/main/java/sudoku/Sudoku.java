 * In the original exercise, the focus is in validating the different rows,
 * columns and subgrids of a Sudoku board represented as nested lists. This
 * exercise takes a bit different approach by separating the logic of the Sudoku
 * game into this class and using the Grid class to store the numbers in a
 * two-dimensional grid.
